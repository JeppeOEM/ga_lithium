## Description

A program that evolves Snake-playing agents using a genetic algorithm.

## Features

1. Custom Genetic Algorithm
At the heart of the system is a genetic algorithm designed from scratch, tailored specifically for the Snake problem. It handles:
Encoding of agent behavior or network parameters
Fitness evaluation based on game performance
Selection, crossover, and mutation
Generation lifecycle and evolutionary improvement
The GA progressively improves agent performance by evolving strategies that maximize survival time, food collection, or score.

2. Parameter Testing
To support experimentation, the program includes built-in testing capabilities that allow you to:
Run batches of simulations automatically and
Compare performance across different GA configurations
